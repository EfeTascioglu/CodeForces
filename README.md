### Key Insights Gained:
- **1918 - D**
    - This is a question where finding the solution is very hard, but checking if a solution is valid is very easy (O(n)). 
    - Since the solution (cost) is an integer, and the cost function is such that if n solves, n+1 also solves. We can search through these costs in log(n) time, resulting in O(nlogn) time.

### Auto-Running Test Cases:
Note: Can only sh scripts in Git Bash on Windows (See dropdown next to start terminal in vsCode)
